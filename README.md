  Langchain is a developement framework to simplify the development of application powered by LLMs. It provides building blocks for many functionalities to ease the development process.
  
  *L1-Model_prompt_parser : 
    This module deals with Prompt templates and Output parsers
    * Prompt templates : LangChain's prompt templates helps to prepare instructions for LLM. This functionality is essential for efficient formating, organization and reuse of prompts. 
    * Output parsers   : LangChain's output parsers helps to parse the completions from LLM into more structured format for further processing.This functionality is essential for extracting and interpreting meaningful information from model outputs.
