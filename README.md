<h1>Langchain Notes</h1>
<p>    Langchain is a development framework designed to streamline the creation of applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides essential building blocks to simplify the development process.</p>
<h2>    L1-Model_prompt_parser</h2>


  <p> <strong>Prompt Templates : </strong> LangChain's prompt templates facilitate the creation of instructions for LLMs. This functionality is crucial for efficiently formatting, organizing, and reusing prompts across applications.</p>


  <p> <strong>Output Parsers :  </strong>LangChain's output parsers convert LLM completions into structured formats, enabling easier extraction and interpretation of meaningful information from model outputs.</p>
<h2>    L3-Memory</h2>


<p> Every input to an LLM is stateless i.e. every interaction is independent and it does not remember any information from previous conversations.This could be problem if we want to build applications like Chatbots.
Chatbots appear to have memory buffer by providing previous context as input along with each interaction. Langchain provides various functionalities to store, format and manipulate this memory buffer. </p>
<h2>    L3-Chains</h2>


<p> Handling diverse queries needs multiple sequences of text processing and intergration. Langchain's chain helps for efficient stream line integration</p>
